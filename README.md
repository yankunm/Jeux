# Jeux: Multithreaded Game Server in ANSI C

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with low-level POSIX
threads, multi-threading safety, concurrency guarantees, and networking.
The overall objective is to implement a simple game server that allows
users to play each other in a two-player game and assigns them numerical
"ratings" that reflect their performance relative to other players.

### Takeaways

After completing this homework, you should:

* Have a basic understanding of socket programming
* Understand thread execution, mutexes, and semaphores
* Have an advanced understanding of POSIX threads
* Have some insight into the design of concurrent data structures
* Have enhanced your C programming abilities

## Hints and Tips

* We strongly recommend you check the return codes of all system
  calls. This will help you catch errors.

* **BEAT UP YOUR OWN CODE!** Throw lots of concurrent calls at your
  data structures to ensure safety.

* Your code should **NEVER** crash. We will be deducting points for
  each time your program crashes during grading. Make sure your code
  handles invalid usage gracefully.

* You should make use of the macros in `debug.h`. You would never
  expect a library to print arbitrary statements as it could interfere
  with the program using the library. **FOLLOW THIS CONVENTION!**
  `make debug` is your friend.

## Helpful Resources

### Textbook Readings

You should make sure that you understand the material covered in
chapters **11.4** and **12** of **Computer Systems: A Programmer's
Perspective 3rd Edition** before starting this assignment.  These
chapters cover networking and concurrency in great detail and will be
an invaluable resource for this assignment.

### pthread Man Pages

The pthread man pages can be easily accessed through your terminal.
However, [this opengroup.org site](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/pthread.h.html)
provides a list of all the available functions.  The same list is also
available for [semaphores](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/semaphore.h.html).

## Getting Started

Fetch and merge the base code for `hw5` as described in `hw0`. You can
find it at this link: https://gitlab02.cs.stonybrook.edu/cse320/hw5.
Remember to use the `--strategy-option=theirs` flag for the `git merge`
command to avoid merge conflicts in the Gitlab CI file.

## The Jeux Game Server: Overview

"Jeux" is a simple implementation of a game server, which allows users
to play each other in a two-player game.  Since implementing the game
itself is not our primary interest in this assignment, we have chosen
to support a very simple game: tic-tac-toe.  However, the design of the
server is such that it would be very easy to substitute a more interesting
game, such as checkers or chess, and with a little bit of extension to
the design it could support multiple types of games at once.

Perhaps the easiest way to understand what the server does is to try it out.
For this purpose, I have provided an executable (`demo/jeux`) for
a completely implemented demonstration version of the server.
Launch it using the following command:

```
$ demo/jeux -p 3333
```

The `-p 3333` option is required, and it specifies the port number on which
the server will listen.  It will be convenient to start the server in a
separate terminal window, because it has not been written to detach from the
terminal and run as a `daemon` like a normal server would do.  This is because
you will be starting and stopping it frequently and you will want to be able
to see the voluminous debugging messages it issues.
The server does not ignore `SIGINT` as a normal daemon would,
so you can ungracefully shut down the server at any time by typing CTRL-C.
Note that the only thing that the server prints are debugging messages;
in a non-debugging setting there should be no output from the server
while it is running.

Once the server is started, you can use a test client program to access it.
The test client is called `util/jclient` and it has been provided only as
a binary executable.  The client is invoked as follows:

```
util/jclient -p <port> [-h <host>] [-d]
```

The `-p` option is required, and it is used to specify the port
number of the server.  If the `-h` option is given, then it specifies
the name of the network host on which the server is running.
If it is not given, then `localhost` is used.
The optional `-d` argument turns on some additional debugging printout
that shows the network packets being sent and received by the client.
Once the client is invoked, it will attempt to connect to the server.
If this succeeds, you will be presented with a command prompt and a
help message that lists the available commands:

```
$ util/jclient -p 3333
Jeux test client.
Commands are:
	help
	login <username>
	users
	invite <username> <role>
	revoke <id>
	accept <id>
	decline id>
	move <id> <move>
	resign <id>
Connected to server localhost:3333
> 
```

Once connected to the server, it is necessary to log in before any commands
other than ``help`` or ``login`` can be used.  Logging in is accomplished
using the ``login`` command, which requires that a username be specified
as an argument.  Any username can be used, as long as it is not currently
in use by some other logged-in user.

Multiple clients can connect to the server at one time.  You should try
opening several terminal windows and starting a client in each of them to see
how this works.  If your computer and/or LAN does not firewall the connections,
you will also be able to connect to a server running on one computer from a
server elsewhere in the Internet.  This will be most likely to work between two
computers on the same LAN (e.g. connected to the same WiFi router, if the
router is configured to allow connected computers to talk to each other).
If it doesn't, there isn't much I can do about it.  In that case you'll just have
to use it on your own computer.

The Jeux server architecture is that of a multi-threaded network server.
When the server is started, a **master** thread sets up a socket on which to
listen for connections from clients.  When a connection is accepted,
a **client service thread** is started to handle requests sent by the client
over that connection.  The client service thread executes a service loop in which
it repeatedly receives a **request packet** sent by the client, performs the request,
and possibly sends one or more packets in response.  The server will also
send packets to the client asynchronously as the result of actions performed by
other users.  For example, whenever a player makes a move, a packet is sent
to the player's opponent announcing that a move has been made and giving the
current game state.

### The Base Code

Here is the structure of the base code:

```
.
├── .gitignore
├── .gitlab-ci.yml
└── hw5
    ├── demo
    │   └── jeux
    ├── include
    │   ├── client.h
    │   ├── client_registry.h
    │   ├── debug.h
    │   ├── game.h
    │   ├── invitation.h
    │   ├── jeux_globals.h
    │   ├── player.h
    │   ├── player_registry.h
    │   ├── protocol.h
    │   └── server.h
    ├── lib
    │   ├── jeux.a
    │   └── jeux_debug.a
    ├── Makefile
    ├── src
    │   └── main.c
    ├── test_output

    │   └── valgrind.out
    ├── tests
    │   └── jeux_tests.c
    └── util
        └── jclient
```

The base code consists of header files that define module interfaces,
a library `jeux.a` containing binary object code for my
implementations of the modules, and a source code file `main.c` that
contains containing a stub for function `main()`.  The `Makefile` is
designed to compile any existing source code files and then link them
against the provided library.  The result is that any modules for
which you provide source code will be included in the final
executable, but modules for which no source code is provided will be
pulled in from the library.

> :scream:  Note that if you define any functions in a particular
> source code module, then you must define all of them
> (at least you must provide stubs), otherwise the linker will pull in
> the library module as well as linking your module and the result will
> be a "multiply defined" error for the functions that you did define.

The `jeux.a` library was compiled without `-DDEBUG`, so it does not
produce any debugging printout.  Also provided is `jeux_debug.a`,
which was compiled with `-DDEBUG`, and which will produce a lot of
debugging output.  The `Makefile` is set up to use `jeux_debug.a` when
you say `make debug` and `jeux.a` when you just say `make`.

The `util` directory contains the executable for the text-based client
program, `jclient`.
Besides the `-h`, `-p`, and `-d` options discussed above, the `jclient` program
also supports the `-q` option, which takes no arguments.  If `-q` is given,
then `jclient` suppresses its normal prompt.  This may be useful for using
`jclient` to feed in pre-programmed commands written in a file.
The list of commands that `jclient` understands is printed out when it starts
and can also be viewed by typing `help` at the command prompt.

Most of the detailed specifications for the various modules and functions
that you are to implement are provided in the comments in the header
files in the `include` directory.  In the interests of brevity and avoiding
redundancy, those specifications are not reproduced in this document.
Nevertheless, the information they contain is very important, and constitutes
the authoritative specification of what you are to implement.

> :scream: The various functions and variables defined in the header files
> constitute the **entirety** of the interfaces between the modules in this program.
> Use these functions and variables as described and **do not** introduce any
> additional functions or global variables as "back door" communication paths
> between the modules.  If you do, the modules you implement will not interoperate
> properly with my implementations, and it will also likely negatively impact
> our ability to test your code.

The test file I have provided contains some code to start a server and
attempt to connect to it.  It will probably be useful while you are
working on `main.c`.

## Additional Background Information

### Reference Counting

Many of the modules in the Jeux server use the technique of **reference counting**.
A reference count is a field maintained in an object to keep track of the number
of extant pointers to that object.  Each time a new pointer to the object is created,
the reference count is incremented.  Each time a pointer is released, the reference
count is decremented.  A reference-counted object is freed when, and only when,
the reference count reaches zero.  Using this scheme, once a thread has obtained
a pointer to an object, with the associated incremented reference count,
it can be sure that until it explicitly releases that object and decrements the
reference count, that the object will not be freed.

In the Jeux server, several types of objects are reference counted;
namely, `CLIENT`, `GAME`, `INVITATION`, and `PLAYER`.
The specifications of the functions provided by the various modules include
information on when reference counts are incremented and whose responsibility
it is to decrement these reference counts.  It is important to pay attention to this
information -- if you do not, your implementation will end up with storage leaks,
or worse, segmentation faults due to "dangling pointers".
A number of "get" functions do not increment the reference count of the object
they return.  This is to make them more convenient to use in a setting in which
one is already holding a reference to the containing object.
As long as the containing object is not freed, neither will the objects returned
by the "get" function.  However, if you obtain an object by a "get" function,
and then decrement the reference count on the containing object, it is possible
that the containing object will be freed as a result.  This will result in the
contained objects having their reference counts decremented, and those objects
might then be freed.  You could then end up with a "dangling pointer" to a free object.
To avoid this, if you intend to use a pointer returned by a "get" function after
the containing object has had its reference count decreased, then you should first
explicitly increase the reference count of the object returned by "get" so that
the pointer is guaranteed to be valid until you are finished with it.

Finally, note that, in a multi-threaded setting, the reference count in an object
is shared between threads and therefore needs to be protected by a mutex if
it is to work reliably.

### Thread Safety

Nearly all of the modules in the Jeux server implement data that is shared
by multiple threads, so synchronization has to be used to make these modules
thread-safe.  The basic approach to this is for each object to contain
a mutex which is locked while the object is being manipulated and unlocked
when the manipulation is finished.  The mutexes will be private fields of the
objects, which are not exposed by the interfaces of the modules.
It will be your responsibility to include the necessary mutexes in your
implementation and to determine when the mutexes should be locked or
unlocked in each function.  Some modules may need some additional synchronization
features; for example, for the client registry it is suggested that you use
a semaphore in order to implement the `creg_wait_for_empty` functionality.

Functions that operate on more than one object at a time require special
care in order to avoid the possibility of deadlock.  An example of this
is the `player_post_result` function of the player module.  This function
needs to update the ratings of two players based on the result of a
just-completed game between those players and the current ratings of those
players.  A correct rating update involves the transfer of some number of
rating points from one player to the other, so that the total number of
rating points in the system is conserved.
If the `PLAYER` objects are locked one at a time, then rating updates going
on concurrently could violate this conservation property.
On the other hand, unless some care is taken, attempting to lock two
`PLAYER` objects at once could result in deadlock.
More generally, whenever one mutex is already held while an attempt is
made to lock another, care needs to be taken to avoid deadlock.
Refer to information given in the lecture notes for some ideas on strategies
to prevent this.

### Debugging Multi-threaded Programs

GDB has support for debugging multi-threaded programs.
At any given time, there is one thread on which the debugger is currently
focused.  The usual commands such as `bt` (backtrace, to get a stack trace)
pertain to the current thread.  If you want to find out about a different
thread, you need to change the focus to that thread.
The `info threads` command will show you a list of the existing threads.
Each thread has a corresponding "Id" which you can use to specify that
thread to `gdb`.  The command `thread N` (replace `N` by the ID of a thread)
will switch the focus to that particular thread.

## Task I: Server Initialization

When the base code is compiled and run, it will print out a message
saying that the server will not function until `main()` is
implemented.  This is your first task.  The `main()` function will
need to do the following things:

- Obtain the port number to be used by the server from the command-line
  arguments.  The port number is to be supplied by the required option
  `-p <port>`.
  
- Install a `SIGHUP` handler so that clean termination of the server can
  be achieved by sending it a `SIGHUP`.  Note that you need to use
  `sigaction()` rather than `signal()`, as the behavior of the latter is
  not well-defined in a multithreaded context.

- Set up the server socket and enter a loop to accept connections
  on this socket.  For each connection, a thread should be started to
  run function `jeux_client_service()`.

These things should be relatively straightforward to accomplish, given the
information presented in class and in the textbook.  If you do them properly,
the server should function and accept connections on the specified port,
and you should be able to connect to the server using the test client.
Note that if you build the server using `make debug`, then the binaries
I have supplied will produce a fairly extensive debugging trace of what
they are doing.  This, together with the specifications in this document
and in the header files, will likely be invaluable to you in understanding
the desired behavior of the various modules.

## Task II: Send and Receive Functions

The header file `include/protocol.h` defines the format of the packets
used in the Jeux network protocol.  The concept of a protocol is an
important one to understand.  A protocol creates a standard for
communication so that any program implementing the protocol will be able
to connect and operate with any other program implementing the same
protocol.  Any client should work with any server if they both
implement the same protocol correctly.  In the Jeux protocol,
clients and servers exchange **packets** with each other.  Each packet
has two parts: a fixed-size header that describes the packet, and an
optional **payload** that can carry arbitrary data.  The fixed-size
header always has the same size and format, which is given by the
`JEUX_PACKET_HEADER` structure; however the payload can be of arbitrary size.
One of the fields in the header tells how long the payload is.

- The function `proto_send_packet` is used to send a packet over a
network connection.  The `fd` argument is the file descriptor of a
socket over which the packet is to be sent.  The `hdr` argument is a
pointer to the fixed-size packet header.  The `data` argument is a
pointer to the data payload, if there is one, otherwise it is `NULL`.
The `proto_send_packet` function uses the `write()` system call
write the packet header to the "wire" (i.e. the network connection).
If the length field of the header specifies a nonzero payload length,
then an additional `write()` call is used to write the payload data
to the wire immediately following the header.

> :nerd:  The `proto_send_packet` assumes that multi-byte fields in
> the packet passed to it are stored in **network byte order**,
> which is a standardized byte order for sending multi-byte values
> over the network.  Note that, as it happens, network byte order
> is different than the **host byte order** used on the x86-64 platforms
> we are using, so you must convert multi-byte quantities from host
> to network byte order when storing them in a packet, and you must

> using the library functions `htons()`, `htonl()`, `ntohs()`, `ntohl()`,
> *etc*.  See the man page for `ntohl()` for details and a full list
> of the available functions.

- The function `proto_recv_packet()` reverses the procedure in order to
receive a packet.  It first uses the `read()` system call to read a
fixed-size packet header from the wire.  If the length field of the header
is nonzero then an additional `read()` is used to read the payload from the
wire (note that the length field arrives in network byte order!).
The `proto_recv_packet()` uses `malloc()` to allocate memory for the
payload (if any), whose length is not known until the packet header is read.
A pointer to the payload is stored in a variable supplied by the caller.
It is the caller's responsibility to `free()` the payload once it is
no longer needed.

**NOTE:** Remember that it is always possible for `read()` and `write()`
to read or write fewer bytes than requested.  You must check for and
handle these "short count" situations.

Implement these functions in a file `protocol.c`.  If you do it
correctly, the server should function as before.

## Task III: Client Registry

You probably noticed the initialization of the `client_registry`
variable in `main()` and the use of the `creg_wait_for_empty()`
function in `terminate()`.  The client registry provides a way of
keeping track of the number of client connections that currently exist,
and to allow a "master" thread to forcibly shut down all of the
connections and to await the termination of all server threads
before finally terminating itself.  It is much more organized and
modular to simply present to each of the server threads a condition
that they can't fail to notice (i.e. EOF on the client connection)
and to allow themselves to perform any necessary finalizations and shut
themselves down, than it is for the main thread to try to reach in
and understand what the server threads are doing at any given time
in order to shut them down cleanly.

The functions provided by a client registry are specified in the
`client_registry.h` header file.  Provide implementations for these
functions in a file `src/client_registry.c`.  Note that these functions
need to be thread-safe (as will most of the functions you implement
for this assignment), so synchronization will be required.  Use a
mutex to protect access to the thread counter data.  Use a semaphore
to perform the required blocking in the `creg_wait_for_empty()`
function.  To shut down a client connection, use the `shutdown()`
function described in Section 2 of the Linux manual pages.
It is sufficient to use `SHUT_RD` to shut down just the read-side
of the connection, as this will cause the client service thread to
see an EOF indication and terminate.

Implementing the client registry should be a fairly easy warm-up
exercise in concurrent programming.  If you do it correctly, the
Bourse server should still shut down cleanly in response to SIGHUP
using your version.

**Note:** You should test your client registry separately from the
server.  Create test threads that rapidly call `creg_register()` and
`creg_unregister()` methods concurrently and then check that a call to the
`creg_wait_for_empty()` function blocks until the number of registered
clients reaches zero, and then returns.

## Task IV: Client Service Thread

Next, you should implement the thread function that performs service
for a client.  This function is called `jeux_client_service`, and
you should implement it in the `src/server.c` file.

The `jeux_client_service` function is invoked as the **thread function**
for a thread that is created (using ``pthread_create()``) to service a
client connection.
The argument is a pointer to the integer file descriptor to be used
to communicate with the client.  Once this file descriptor has been
retrieved, the storage it occupied needs to be freed.
The thread must then become detached, so that it does not have to be
explicitly reaped, and it must register the client file descriptor with
the client registry.
Finally, the thread should enter a service loop in which it repeatedly
receives a request packet sent by the client, carries out the request,
and sends any response packets.

The possible types of packets that can be received are listed below,
together with a discussion of how the server responds to these packets.
Note that much of the functionality described is not performed directly
by the server module, but by functions in other modules which it calls.

- `LOGIN`:  The payload portion of the packet contains the player username
(**not** null-terminated) given by the user.
Upon receipt of a `LOGIN` packet, the `client_login()` function should be called.
In case of a successful `LOGIN` an `ACK` packet with no payload should be
sent back to the client.  In case of an unsuccessful `LOGIN`, a `NACK` packet
(also with no payload) should be sent back to the client.

Until a `LOGIN` has been successfully processed, other packets sent by the
client should elicit a `NACK` response from the server.
Once a `LOGIN` has been successfully processed, other packets should be
processed normally, and `LOGIN` packets should result in a `NACK`.

- `USERS`:  This type of packet has no payload.  The server responds by
sending an `ACK` packet whose payload consists of a text string in which
each line gives the username of a currently logged in player, followed by
a single `TAB` character, followed by the player's current rating.

- `INVITE`:  The payload of this type of packet is the username of another
player, who is invited to play a game.  The sender of the `INVITE` is the
"source" of the invitation; the invited player is the "target".
The `role` field of the header contains an integer value that specifies the
role in the game to which the player is invited (1 for first player to move,
2 for second player to move).
The server responds either by sending an `ACK` with no payload in case of
success or a `NACK` with no payload in case of error.  In case of an `ACK`,
the `id` field of the `ACK` packet will contain the integer ID that the
source client can use to identify that invitation in the future.
An `INVITED` packet will be sent to the target as a notification that the
invitation has been made.  This `id` field of this packet gives an ID that
the target can use to identify the invitation.  Note that, in general,
the IDs used by the source and target to refer to an invitation will be
different from each other.

- `REVOKE`:  This type of packet has no payload.  The `id` field of the header
contains the ID of the invitation to be revoked.  The revoking player must
be the source of that invitation.  The server responds by
attempting to revoke the invitation.  If successful, an `ACK` with no payload
sent, otherwise a `NACK` with no payload is sent.  A successful revocation causes
a `REVOKED` packet to be sent to notify the invitation target.

- `DECLINE`:  This type of packet is similar to `REVOKE`, except that it is
sent by the target of an invitation in order to decline it.  The server's
response is either an `ACK` or `NACK` as for `REVOKE`.  If the invitation is
successfully declined, a `DECLINED` packet is sent to notify the source.

- `ACCEPT`:  This type of packet is sent by the target of an invitation in
order to accept it.  The `id` field of the header contains the ID of the invitation
to be accepted.  If the invitation has been revoked or previously accepted,
a `NACK` is sent by the server.  Otherwise a new game is created and an `ACK`
is sent by the server.  If the target's role in the game is that of first player
to move, then the payload of the `ACK` will contain a string describing the
initial game state.  In addition, the source of the invitation will be sent an
`ACCEPTED` packet, the `id` field of which contains the source's ID for the
invitation.  If the source's role is that of the first player to move, then
the payload of the `ACCEPTED` packet will contain a string describing the
initial game state.

- `MOVE`:  This type of packet is sent by a client to make a move in a game
in progress.  The `id` field of the header contains the client's ID for the
invitation that resulted in the game.  The payload of the packet contains a
string describing the move.  For the tic-tac-toe game, a move string may
consist either of a single digit in the range ['1' - '9'], or a string consisting
of such a digit, followed either by "<-X" or "<-O".  The latter forms specify
the role of the player making the move as well as the square to be occupied
by the player's mark.  The server will respond with `ACK` with no payload if
the move is legal and is successfully applied to the game state, otherwise
with `NACK` with no payload.  In addition, the opponent of the player making
the move will be sent a `MOVED` packet, the `id` field of which contains the
opponent's ID for the game and the payload of which contains a string that
describes the new game state after the move.

- `RESIGN`:  This type of packet is sent by a client to resign a game in
progress.  The `id` field of the header contains the client's ID for the
invitation that resulted in the game.  There is no payload.
If the resignation is successful, then the server responds with `ACK`,
otherwise with `NACK`.  In addition, the opponent of the player who is
resigning is sent a `RESIGNED` packet, the `id` field of which contains the
opponent's ID for the game.

There is one other packet type not mentioned in the above discussion.
This is the `ENDED` packet type.  This type of packet is sent by the server
when a game terminates to notify the clients participating in a game that
the game is over.  The `id` field of the packet header contains an ID that
identifies the game to the client.  The `role` field of the packet header
contains an integer value 0, 1, 2, according to whether the game was drawn,
the first player won, or the second player won.

## Task V: Invitation Module

An `INVITATION` records the status of an offer, made by one `CLIENT`
to another, to participate in a `GAME`.  The `CLIENT` that initiates
the offer is called the "source" of the invitation, and the client that
is the recipient of the offer is called the "target" of the invitation.
An `INVITATION` can be in one of three states: "open", "accepted",
or "closed.  An `INVITATION` in the "accepted" state will contain a
reference to a `GAME` that is in progress.
The invitation module provides the functions listed below.
For more detailed specifications, see the comments in the header file
`invitation.h`.

- `inv_create`: Create a new `INVITATION`.
- `inv_ref`: Increase the reference count on an `INVITATION`.
- `inv_unref`: Decrease the reference count on an `INVITATION`, freeing the
  `INVITATION` and its contents if the reference count has reached zero.
- `inv_get_source`: Get the `CLIENT` that is the source of an `INVITATION`.
- `inv_get_target`: Get the `CLIENT` that is the target of an `INVITATION`.
- `inv_get_source_role`: Get the `GAME_ROLE` to be played by the source
  of an `INVITATION`.
- `inv_get_target_role`: Get the `GAME_ROLE` to be played by the target
  of an `INVITATION`.
- `inv_get_game`: Get the game (if any game is in progress) associated with
  an `INVITATION`.
- `inv_accept`: Accept an `INVITATION`, changing it from the "open" state
  to the "accepted" state, and creating a new `GAME`.
- `inv_close`: Close an invitation, changing it from either the "open" state
  or the "accepted" state to the "closed" state.  Closing an `INVITATION`
  with a game in progress will result in the resignation of the player
  doing the closing.

## Task VI: Client Module

This is the most complex module, so you should work on it only when you
get to the point that you feel you have developed some understanding of
how the Jeux server works.  A `CLIENT` represents the state of a network
client connected to the system.  It contains the file descriptor of the
connection to the client and it provides functions for sending packets
to the client.  If the client is logged in, it contains a reference to
a PLAYER object and it contains a list of invitations for which the client
is either the source or the target.  CLIENT objects are managed by a
client registry.  The client module provides the functions listed below.
For more detailed specifications, see the comments in the header file
`client.h`.

- `client_create`: Create a new `CLIENT` object.
- `client_ref`: Increase the reference count on a `CLIENT` object.
- `client_unref`: Decrease the reference count on a `CLIENT`, freeing the
  `CLIENT` and its contents if the reference count has reached zero.
- `client_login`: Log in a `CLIENT` as a specified `PLAYER`.
- `client_logout`: Log out a `CLIENT`.
- `client_get_player`: Get the `PLAYER` for a logged-in client.
- `client_get_fd`: Get the file descriptor for the network connection
  associated with a `CLIENT`.
- `client_send_packet`: Send a packet over the network to a connected
  client.
- `client_send_ack`: Send an `ACK` packet to a client.
- `client_send_nack`: Send a `NACK` packet to a client.
- `client_make_invitation`: Make a new invitation from a specified
  "source" `CLIENT` to a specified "target" `CLIENT`.
- `client_revoke_invitation`: Called by the source of an `INVITATION`
   to revoke it.  The target of the invitation is sent a `REVOKED` packet.
- `client_decline_invitation`: Called by the target of an `INVITATION`
   to decline it. The source of the invitation is sent a `DECLINED` packet.
- `client_accept_invitation`: Called by the target of an `INVITATION`
   to accept it.  A new `GAME` is created and the source of the
   invitation is sent an `ACCEPTED` packet.
- `client_resign_game`: Called by either the source or target of an
  `INVITATION` to resign a game in progress.  The invitation is removed
  from the source's and target's lists and the opponent of the caller
  is sent a `RESIGNED` packet.
- `client_make_move`: Called by a participant in a `GAME` to make a move.
  A `MOVED` packet is sent to the caller's opponent.  If the move results
  in the game being over, then the invitation containing the terminated
  game is removed from both player's lists, an `ENDED` packet is sent
  to both players, and the result of the game is posted in order to
  update the players' ratings.

## Task VII: Player Module

A `PLAYER` object represents a user of the system.  A `PLAYER` has a
username, which does not change once the `PLAYER` is created, and it also
has a "rating" which is an integer value that reflects the player's
skill level among all players known to the system.  A player's rating
changes as a result of each game in which the player participates.
The player module provides the functions listed below.
For more detailed specifications, see the comments in the header file
`player.h`.

- `player_create`: Create a new `PLAYER`.
- `player_ref`: Increase the reference count on a `PLAYER`.
- `player_unref`: Decrease the reference count on a `PLAYER`, freeing the
  `PLAYER` and its contents if the reference count has reached zero.
- `player_get_name`: Get the username of a `PLAYER`.
- `player_get_rating`: Get the rating of a `PLAYER`.
- `player_post_result`: Post the result of a game between two players,
   updating their ratings accordingly (see the specs for more information).

## Task VIII: Player Registry Module

A player registry keeps track of information about known users of the system,
in the form of a mapping from user names to `PLAYER` objects.
This information persists from the time a player is first registered until
the server is shut down.  It provides the functions listed below.
For more detailed specifications, see the comments in the header file
`player_registry.h`.

- `preg_init`: Initialize a new player registry.
- `preg_fini`: Finalize a player registry, freeing all associated resources.
- `preg_register`: Register a player with a specified user name or look up
  an existing player with that name.

## Task IX: Game Module

A `GAME` represents the current state of a game between participating players.
I have listed this module last because most of what is involved in coding it
has to do with the game (tic-tac-toe) that is implemented, rather than
additional features involving threads and concurrency.  It is certainly not
the main point of the assignment to program the game of tic-tac-toe,
so you should not get bogged down here.
In addition to the `GAME` type,
this module also defines the auxiliary types `GAME_MOVE`, which represents a
move in a game, and `GAME_ROLE`, which represents the role of a player in the
game.  The `GAME_ROLE` type is an enumerated type which is defined in the
`game.h` header file, but the details of the `GAME_MOVE` structure are
up to you.

The functions provided by the game module are listed below.
For more detailed specifications, see the comments in the header file `game.h`.

- `game_create`: Create a new game.
- `game_ref`: Increase the reference count on a `GAME`.
- `game_unref`: Decrease the reference count on a `GAME`, freeing the
  `GAME` and its contents if the reference count has reached zero.
- `game_apply_move`: Apply a `GAME_MOVE` to a `GAME`.
- `game_resign`: Called by one of the players to resign the game.
- `game_unparse_state`:  Get a string that describes the current `GAME` state,
  in a format appropriate for human users.
- `game_is_over`: Determine if a specified `GAME` has terminated.
- `game_get_winner`: Get the `GAME_ROLE` of the player who has won the game.
- `game_parse_move`: Attempt to interpret a string as a move in the specified
  `GAME`, for the player in the specified `GAME_ROLE`.
- `game_unparse_move`: Get a string that describes a specified `GAME_MOVE`,
  in a format appropriate to be shown to human users.
